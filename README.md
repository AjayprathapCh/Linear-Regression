# Linear-Reression

The data set consists of customers data of an insurance company.

The aim is to predict insurance charges payable by a customer, given the attributes like Age, Gender, whether s/he is a smoker or not, region and BMI.

I have used Linear Regression technique to predict insurance charges, which is a continuous variable.
